# Project: Interactive Storytelling with Pygame

## Description
This project introduces students to basic interactive programming using Python's pygame library. You will create a simple interactive story where user choices affect the outcome. This helps you understand the fundamentals of user interaction, graphical displays, and branching storylines.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed
- pygame library installed

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment
To keep dependencies organized and prevent conflicts, it's recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Create a Virtual Environment:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the Virtual Environment:

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Pygame:
With the virtual environment activated, install pygame by running:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Code

- Clone or Download the Repository
- Activate the Virtual Environment
- Make sure to activate the virtual environment you set up.
- Run the Python Script
- Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the Python files, and run:
```bash
python add-user-interaction.py
```

## Project Contents

`story-game.py`: Use this file to get familiar with creating a game scene, changing the colour, and closing the game.

`render-messages-on-screen.py`: Use this file to get familiar with creating customisable messages to show on screen to the player.



## How to Use

### Basic Setup: 
Start by running the provided script to open the interactive story window.

### Make Choices: 
Press the keys (1, 2, etc.) to make choices that will affect the storyline and lead to different scenes.

## Customization Ideas

Add More Scenes: Expand the story by adding more branches, scenes, and interactions.

Use Images: Replace plain backgrounds with images to enhance the visual experience.

Character Movement: Introduce a character sprite and allow the user to move it using arrow keys.
